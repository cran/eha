1.3-6	(June 18, 2011)
	* coxph, phreg, aftreg: Bug fix: Logical covariates now OK.
	  (converted to factor).
	* phreg: Removed "coxph" from "class".
	* aftreg: Ditto.
	* weibreg: Ditto.
	* oldmort: New data set.
	* coxph: added return values 'df' and 'n'.
	* coxph, phreg, aftreg: Added extractAIC and nobs methods.

1.3-5	(May 20, 2011)
	* infants: New data set containing matched data on infant and
	maternal mortality.

1.3-4	(May 10, 2011)
	* toBinary: Now includes also risksets without survivors (if any).

	* fert: Row names changed to row numbers.

	* swe07: New data set.

	* Spelling errors (some!) corrected in documentation.

1.3-3	(May 4, 2011)
	* male.mortality: Old name (male.mortality) of data frame mort
	reinstalled.
	Now known under two names. Overlapping spells no longer exist.

	* fert: Documentation corrected.

	* toDate: Now works as intended.

1.3-2	(March 1, 2011)
	* dllogis: Bug fixed.

	* hllogis: Bux fixed.

1.3-1	(January 15, 2011)
	* phreg: Fixed error and (some) numerical instability in the
	estimation of the Gompertz proportionla hazards model (seems to be
	very sensitive to good start values!).

	* plot.phreg: Fixed 'ylim' for cumulative hazards plot.

	* male.mortality: Data set renamed to

	* mort: The new name. (Just for convenience!)

1.3-0	(January 4, 2011)
	* coxreg: Major revision, calls 'coxph' in 'survival' (thanks to
	Terry Therneau!) for ordinary requests. Reason: speed. The argument
	'center' is deprecated, centering of covariates is now routinely
	made. Affects the estimation of the baseline hazard, which is done
	at the means of the columns of the original design matrix.

	* phreg: Argument 'center' is deprecated. Centering is routinely
	performed, so the baseline hazard is estimated at the means of the
	columns of the original design matrix.

	* aftreg: Corrected error in documentation and made the argument
	'center' deprecated.

	* aftreg: Estimation of intercept ("scale") is now comparable with
	corresponding estimate of Intercept in 'survreg'. 'shape' in
	aftreg is still '1 / scale' in survreg. Regression coefficients still
	have different signs but the same absolute values.

	* join.spells: a few bugs fixed, now allows for factor covariates.

	* male.mortality: data set "joined".

	* fert: is a new data set. Contains data on 19th century marital
	fertility from a parish in northern Sweden.

1.2-18	(February 28, 2010)
	* aftreg.fit: Check of data consistency in case of more than one
	record per individual added.
	* aftreg.fit: Fixed memory allocation bug in C code. This bug was
	not fatal (too much memory was allocated), but caused a severe
	performance problem, especially on Windows.

1.2-17	(February 23, 2010)
	* aftreg: 'dist = "gompertz"' should now work (realizing that it
	is a special case of 'dist = "EV").
	* phreg: Fixed bugs for the cases with fixed shape (includes 'dist
	= "gompertz"'.
	* aftreg: 'offset' works now.
	* phreg: Ditto.
	* check.dist: Bug fixed for 'dist = "gompertz"' (again!)
	* plot.phreg: Ditto.

1.2-16	(February 19, 2010)
	* aftreg: 'dist = "gompertz"' is unreliable, so changed the
	example and added a note with a warning. Is also an item on the
	ToDo list now.

1.2-15	(February 18, 2010)
	* aftreg: argument 'id' now works as intended, i.e., is looked for
	in 'data' (or 'parent.frame()')
	* print: functions return invisibly 'x'.
	* coxreg: argument 'weights' now works as intended, i.e., is looked for
	in 'data' (or 'parent.frame()')

1.2-14	(October 29, 2009)
	* check.dist: Bad 'ylim' fixed.
	* aftreg: Gompertz distribution had a bug; now fixed.

1.2-13	(October 26, 2009)
	* plot.coxreg: Bug fixed in call to plot.hazdata (wrong order of args).

1.2-12	(October 15, 2009)
	* aftreg: Works now for time-varying covariates. Not polished.

1.2-7	(August 13, 2009)

	* coxreg: Time-dependent offset introduced. 


1.2-6	(August 11, 2009)

	* coxreg.fit: Time-dependent weights work now. 

1.2-5	(August 2, 2009)

	* coxreg: Added (time-varying) weighted Cox regression. Returns
	error code 1 if failure, with a warning.    
	* check.dist: Can now handle stratified models.

1.2-4	(Jan 12, 2009)

	* Bugs in qEV, rEV, all Gompertz functions, plus documentation of
	EV and Gompertz fixed. Note that these bugs did not affect aftreg
	or phreg! However,
	* check.dist had to be revised due to the above bugs.

1.2-2	(Aug 25, 2008)

	* Bug in coxreg, method = "ml" fixed.
	* Bug in coxreg, calculation of hazard, fixed.
	* Several errors in the documentation fixed.

1.2-0	(Jul 18, 2008)

	* Added functionality: Accelerated failure time models with 
	several distributions, parametric proportional hazards models 
	with the same distributions. All models allow for left truncated 
	and right censored data, as well as for stratification. 
	Plot methods for the new models.  

1.0-1	(Jan 5, 2008) 

	* Added 'risktime' to toBinary output.

0.99	(June 9, 2007) This is the last release before version 1.0!
	
	* Added full profiling to the "ml" and "mppl" methods in
	coxreg.
	* mlreg is now deprecated. Use coxreg with method = ml or = mppl
	
0.98

0.97

0.96-7	(Dec 29, 2006)

	* Corrected a bug in the documentation of 'weibreg'.
	
0.96-6	(Dec 28, 2006)

	* Corrected a bug in weibreg concerning 'center = FALSE'.

0.96-5  (Oct 24, 2006)

        * added a 'terms' object to the output of coxreg and mlreg.

0.96-1  (May 15, 2006) 

	* plot.Surv improved. Suggestions by Dimitri Szerman. (Thanks!)

0.96-0  (April 14, 2006)

	* Weibull regression updated; It is now possible to fit a Weibull
	model to left-truncated and right-censored data without
	covariates. A small error in the documentation of 'weibreg'
	corrected. 

0.94-3	(Aug 22, 2005)

	* 'check.surv': If the 'id' was a factor with unused labels,
	the result was unpredictable. Corrected.

0.94-2  (Jun 27, 2005)

	* Errors in the documentation of 'weibreg' corrected.
	
0.93-0	(Sep 20, 2004) 

	* NAMESPACE introduced for R-2.0.0.

0.92-4 (May 5, 2004)

	* coxreg: 'Error' changed to 'warning' for a singular hessian, in
	which case the new return value is NULL.

0.92-3 (March 19, 2004)

	* table.events: New parameter: 'strict = TRUE'.

	* make.communal: In case of 'communal=FALSE', spells are no longer 
	truncated. Instead a value of NA is given if birthdate is out of
	range. Previous behavior was unpredictable when birthdate was out 
	of range.
	
0.92 (November 12, 2003)
	
	* mlreg: Geometric distribution (i.e., constant baseline discrete
	hazard) added. Not for frailty models, yet (on the TODO list).

	* mlreg: New argument, 'n.points', added to 'control'. Controls
	the number of points used in the Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

	* mlreg: Stricter control of numerical problems, especially in the
	frailty fit.
	
	* clean: Replaced by check.spells and join.spells.

	* Return values changed to conform with R-1.8.0 (and later).
