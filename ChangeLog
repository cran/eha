1.2-4	(Jan 12, 2009)
	* Bugs in qEV, rEV, all Gompertz functions, plus documentation of
	EV and Gompertz fixed. Note that these bugs did not affect aftreg
	or phreg! However,
	* check.dist had to be revised due to the above bugs.

1.2-2	(Aug 25, 2008)
	* Bug in coxreg, method = "ml" fixed.
	* Bug in coxreg, calculation of hazard, fixed.
	* Several errors in the documentation fixed.

1.2-0	(Jul 18, 2008)

	* Added functionality: Accelerated failure time models with 
	several distributions, parametric proportional hazards models 
	with the same distributions. All models allow for left truncated 
	and right censored data, as well as for stratification. 
	Plot methods for the new models.  

1.0-1	(Jan 5, 2008) 

	* Added 'risktime' to toBinary output.

0.99	(June 9, 2007) This is the last release before version 1.0!
	
	* Added full profiling to the "ml" and "mppl" methods in
	coxreg.
	* mlreg is now deprecated. Use coxreg with method = ml or = mppl
	
0.98

0.97

0.96-7	(Dec 29, 2006)

	* Corrected a bug in the documentation of 'weibreg'.
	
0.96-6	(Dec 28, 2006)

	* Corrected a bug in weibreg concerning 'center = FALSE'.

0.96-5  (Oct 24, 2006)

        * added a 'terms' object to the output of coxreg and mlreg.

0.96-1  (May 15, 2006) 

	* plot.Surv improved. Suggestions by Dimitri Szerman. (Thanks!)

0.96-0  (April 14, 2006)

	* Weibull regression updated; It is now possible to fit a Weibull
	model to left-truncated and right-censored data without
	covariates. A small error in the documentation of 'weibreg'
	corrected. 

0.94-3	(Aug 22, 2005)

	* 'check.surv': If the 'id' was a factor with unused labels,
	the result was unpredictable. Corrected.

0.94-2  (Jun 27, 2005)

	* Errors in the documentation of 'weibreg' corrected.
	
0.93-0	(Sep 20, 2004) 

	* NAMESPACE introduced for R-2.0.0.

0.92-4 (May 5, 2004)

	* coxreg: 'Error' changed to 'warning' for a singular hessian, in
	which case the new return value is NULL.

0.92-3 (March 19, 2004)

	* table.events: New parameter: 'strict = TRUE'.

	* make.communal: In case of 'communal=FALSE', spells are no longer 
	truncated. Instead a value of NA is given if birthdate is out of
	range. Previous behavior was unpredictable when birthdate was out 
	of range.
	
0.92 (November 12, 2003)
	
	* mlreg: Geometric distribution (i.e., constant baseline discrete
	hazard) added. Not for frailty models, yet (on the TODO list).

	* mlreg: New argument, 'n.points', added to 'control'. Controls
	the number of points used in the Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

	* mlreg: Stricter control of numerical problems, especially in the
	frailty fit.
	
	* clean: Replaced by check.spells and join.spells.

	* Return values changed to conform with R-1.8.0 (and later).
