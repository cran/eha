0.92 (November 12, 2003)
	
	* mlreg: Geometric distribution (i.e., constant baseline discrete
	hazard) added. Not for frailty models, yet (on the TODO list).

	* mlreg: New argument, 'n.points', added to 'control'. Controls
	the number of points used in the Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

	* mlreg: Stricter control of numerical problems, especially in the
	frailty fit.
	
	* clean: Replaced by check.spells and join.spells.

	* Return values changed to conform with R-1.8.0 (and later).
